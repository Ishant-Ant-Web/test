          <h3>About ISRO(India Space Research Organization)</h3>
          <p>
          <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is a space agency of the Government of India, headquartered in Bengaluru, Karnataka, founded on August 15, 1969, by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, who is hailed as the father of the Indian space program. ISRO's primary mission is to leverage space technology for national development while advancing space science and exploration. Over the years, ISRO has achieved remarkable milestones, including the successful launch of its lunar missions, Chandrayaan-1, which discovered water on the Moon, and Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission), which made India the first country to succeed in its initial attempt to reach Mars. The organization is also known for its series of communication satellites like GSAT and its regional navigation satellite system, NavIC, which provides accurate positioning information. Looking forward, ISRO continues to pursue ambitious projects such as Chandrayaan-3 for further lunar exploration, the Gaganyaan human spaceflight program, and the Aditya-L1 mission to study the Sun, demonstrating its commitment to advancing space technology and international collaboration in space research.</p>

          <h3>Developing indigenous space technology</h3>
          <p>Developing indigenous space technology is a core focus of ISRO's mission to enhance India's capabilities in space exploration and satellite technology. This involves creating and advancing technologies within India, rather than relying on foreign expertise or equipment. ISRO has made significant progress in developing its own launch vehicles, such as the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), which are designed to place satellites into various orbits. The agency also focuses on designing and manufacturing its own satellites for communication, earth observation, and navigation. By investing in research and development, ISRO aims to foster self-reliance in space technology, reduce costs, and strengthen its position as a leading space agency on the global stage. This commitment to indigenous technology not only supports national objectives but also enhances India's capacity to contribute to international space missions and collaborations.</p>
